# Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network for Ocular Disease Detection

This repository contains the ongoing research project focused on developing a **hybrid classical-quantum neural network (QNN)** for detecting ocular diseases using the highly imbalanced ODIR-5K dataset. The project integrates **quantum computing** with traditional machine learning techniques, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms to explore innovative solutions in medical imaging.
